For developers who are looking to contribute for the front end aspect of the project, redirect to this [repository](https://github.com/Open-Source-Community-VIT-AP/WSoC-TestRepo).

## Prerequisites

Languages and tools you are expected to know before working on the project :

Once the repository is on your local system, you need to create a separate branch to start working.

</pre>

where, branchname is the name of your branch. It is advised that you name the branch after your registration number.

## Things to remember

- All the questions and programs are present in the directory called "core" within the repository.
- Each level has different challenges and different points awarded for each.
- You will be judged based on a total of 100 points, 20 for level 1, 30 for level 2 and 40 for level 3. The rest 10 depends on how you solve the problems given.
- Further details about the challenges in each level will be mentioned in their respective README files.
- You do not necessarily have to add comments for each line, but a short description could gain you a few extra points.
- It is not compulsory to do all the challenges. Do as many as you can before sending us a pull request. However, people who have solved more have a higher edge over others.
- Make sure you fill the "About me.md" file present within the root directory of the repository before sending a pull request.
- Earlier the submission, higher the priority. 
- If you have any queries regarding any of the challenges or the event itself, feel free to create a GitHub issue.
- Have funðŸ’¥âœ¨!

## What next?

There exist two deadlines for submission.\
**September 25th.** For the early birds.\
**October 10th.** For the perfectionists.\
(The earlier, the better ðŸ˜„)

If you've done your best with the branch and have sent it in for merging already, you're on the right track.\
Don't worry about the results, take a break.

We'll contact you if you're in. ðŸ˜‰
