## Getting Started

To start working on the challenges provided, you must first fork this repository. Just press the fork button present in the top right corner of your screen.

Once done, you must be having your own copy of this repository in your GitHub page, just head over to your profile and open ```WSoC-TestRepo2```.

Now, clone your copy of the repository to your local system.

For more details on forking and cloning the repository, click [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) (follow steps 1 and 2).

Once the repository is on your local system, you need to create a separate branch to start working. 

To do this, open your console and "**cd/**" to the repository. Once done, use the command,

<pre>
git checkout -b branchname
</pre>

where, branchname is the name of your branch. It is advised that you name the branch after your registration number. 

You can also branch directly from GitHub, click [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) for more info on that.

Once done, you are all set to get started.

## Things to remember

- All the questions and programs are present in the directory called "core" within the repository.
- Each level has different challenges and different points awarded for each.
- You will be judged based on a total of 100 points, 20 for level 1, 30 for level 2 and 40 for level 3. The rest 10 depends on how you solve the problems given.
- Further details about the challenges in each level will be mentioned in their respective README files.
