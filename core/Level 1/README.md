## About

- Level 1 consists of two simple challenges revolving around Python file handling.
- Maximum points you can gain from this level is 20.
- Distribution of points for each of the challenges is mentioned below.
    - Challenge 1 : 8 points.
    - Challenge 2 : 14 points.

## Challenge 1

The first challenge is quite straight forward. 
- You must read the contents of the "data.pkl" file present inside the "Challenge 1" folder.
- Display each element of the list in an ordered manner.

## Challenge 2

- Create a dictionary of lists. Eg : dict = {'Fruits' : ['Mango', 'Apple', 'Orange'], 'Colours' : ['Blue', 'Green', 'Red']};
- Dump the dictionary object into a pickle file.
- Now, read the pickle file and append an element to any of the lists within the dictionary (can be hard-coded) and save the pickle file after updating. 

In other words, you create a pickle file and save a dictionary of lists in it. Later you update it's content.

## Things to remember

- Files and programs required are already present within each of the challenge's respective folder. However, you can create or modify them as you see fit.
- It is not necessary to take any user input. Feel free to hard code (Unless mentioned otherwise).
- Once a challenge is completed, save the file, take a screenshot of the output and save it within the respective challenge's folder with the name "output".
- It is advised to create a commit after you finish a challenge. However, it is entirely up to you.
