## About

- Finally, in level 3 you will be dealing with various Object-oriented programming concepts in Python.
- Maximum points you can gain from this level is 40.
- There is only one challenge for a total of 40 points. 

## Challenge 1

If you manage to complete this challenge successfully, you can rack a total of 40 points. Since this has the highest weightage compared to all other challenges, do it well.

Details for the challenge is mentioned below :

Consider the following scenario:

- There are different types of sports. Some of them are indoors and some are outdoors. Each have their own properties like, name of the sport, number of players required, time duration (if any), equipment needed (like ball, bat), country of origin etc. 
- In some games there are subtypes, like in cricket T20, One day, or Test match. Each sub type will have its own properties. In some cases, they have redefined the rules of its main type. Like in cricket you have total overs equals to 50 for one day match, 20 for T20 etc. 
- There are a few legends in each of these sports. Consider details of some of such players in each type of sports like, country of origin of that player, name, if whether they are presently playing or not.

Implement the above scenario using Python. Use its different features like, class, objects, list of objects, method overloading, inheritance, method overriding, encapsulation, polymorphism, etc. wherever needed. Take help from different keywords like super, self etc.

## Things to remember 

- There is no fixed solution for this challenge, so be creative.
- While hard coding is an option, it would be advised to allow the users to at least select the sport details they are looking for.
- It is not mandatory to allow users to add their own sports and info. However, it is entirely up to you.
- You do not have to take screenshot of anything. Just save the program and commit your changes.
- Work on the challenge inside the "Challenge 1" folder present in "Level 3". 
- Feel free to create multiple files and folders as per your need.
